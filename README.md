# `hcloud with nixops`

Hello, this should serve as a little example on how to get up and running with
nixops using the fantastic hetznercloud plugin by `lukebfox` 
[lukebfox/nixops-hetznercloud](https://github.com/lukebfox/nixops-hetznercloud)
and the nixops-with-plugins repository by `typetetris` at 
[typetetris/nixops-with-plugins](https://github.com/typetetris/nixops-with-plugins)
which I did fork to only include hetzner.

This repository is using `niv`, and by issueing `nix-shell`, you should have a
working shell that can issue nixops deployments using hcloud!
